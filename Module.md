# Module EconoShow
This app was created towards the efforts of providing information in an offline context for Econocorp's Packaging Machinery. It was installed onto a large, Android tablet device that can be safely interacted with by customers and sales people.

This documentation was created as a means of keeping track of how the app was built so that others may extend it or borrow from it when creating a new app.

This project was originally proposed by Sam Goldberg and created by Marcus Johnson.
